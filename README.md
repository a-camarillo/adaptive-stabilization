# Global Finite-Time Stability Adaptive Switching Control

This is a python implementation of the GFTS adaptive switching controller for
nonlinear systems with unknown control directions proposed in the 
[2016 paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.automatica.2016.03.005) by J. Wu,
W. Chen, and J. Li.

This implementation is being completed as the final project for the CSULB
graduate course, MAE 573 Modern Control of Dynamic Systems(Fall 2024)
